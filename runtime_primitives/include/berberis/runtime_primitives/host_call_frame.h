// Assume we have some meaningful guest state, for example, at trampoline or at signal handler call.
// We want to call nested guest function, for example, callback passed into trampoline or guest
// signal handler. We want to restore the state after guest nested function returns.
//
// Assume guest function to be called conforms to procedure calling standard. In particular, it is
// expected to preserve caller-saved registers, and to return by jumping to a given return address.
//
// Assume we want to allow guest unwinder to unwind to the previous guest state. For that, we should
// only save state into guest accessible memory - namely, into guest stack/registers.
//
// First, we want guest execution to stop when guest function returns. For that, we provide special
// return address that is treated as stop by dispatcher.
//
// Next, parameters are passed afterwards, so at this point we don't know how much stack they will
// need. To restore stack after the call, we need to save current stack pointer in a caller-saved
// register.
//
// Finally, we need to save the registers that are not preserved by guest function.
