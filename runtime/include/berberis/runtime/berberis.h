// Berberis explicit lazy initialization.
// Might be called multiple times safely.
// TODO(b/288956745): the requirement to call initialization multiple times
// comes from our unit tests. Unfortunately, many of them are not true unit
// tests, as they use the whole berberis library. As tests might run in any
// order and probably even in parallel, the right place for one-time init is
// right before RUN_ALL_TESTS(), which is hard to get in. The remaining option
// is to make initialization lazy and to call it from every test.
// This is actually a HACK, needed while there is stuff that's initialized
// inside berberis but gets accessed from outside - which means access
// can occur before initialization. We are cleaning this up. At the end,
// initialization will be truly lazy and this function will go away.
